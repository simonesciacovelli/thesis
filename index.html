<h1>Against Nature</h1>

<h3>by Joris-Karl Huysmans</h3>

<h2>

<p class="par1">
"Well, then, society, crash to <a class="a1">ruin!</a> Die, aged world!" cried Des Esseintes, angered by the ignominy of the spectacle he had <a class="a5">evoked</a>. This cry of <a class="a2">hate</a> broke the nightmare that <a class="a5b">oppressed</a> him.
</p>

<p>
<a class="a3">"Ah!"</a> he exclaimed, "To think that all this is not a <a class="a4">dream</a>, to think that I am going to return into the cowardly and servile crowd of this century!" To console himself, he recalled the comforting maxims of <a class="a2">Schopenhauer</a>, and repeated to himself the sad axiom of <a class="a5">Pascal</a>: "The soul is pained by all things it thinks upon." But the <a class="a4b">words</a> resounded in his mind like sounds deprived of <a class="a3b">sense</a>; his ennui disintegrated, lifting all significance from the words, all healing virtue, all effective and <a class="a3">gentle</a> vigor.
</p>

<p>
He came at last to perceive that the reasonings of <a class="a2">pessimism</a> availed little in comforting him, that <a class="a4">impossible</a> faith in a future life alone would pacify him.
</p>


<p>
An access of <a class="a5b">rage</a> swept aside, like a <a class="a2">hurricane</a>, his attempts at resignation and indifference. He could <a class="a3">no</a> longer conceal the hideous truth â€” nothing was left, all was in ruins. The bourgeoisie were gormandizing on the <a class="a2">solemn</a> ruins of the <a class="a3b">Church</a> which had become a place of rendez-vous, a <a class="a4b">mass</a> of rubbish, soiled by petty puns and <a class="a5b">scandalous</a> jests. Were the terrible God of Genesis and the Pale Christ of Golgotha not going to prove their <a class="a1">existence</a> by <a class="a3b">commanding</a> the cataclysms of yore, by rekindling the flames that once consumed the sinful cities? Was this <a class="a2b">degradation</a> to continue to flow and <a class="a2">cover</a> with its pestilence the old world planted with seeds of iniquities and <a class="a5b">shames</a>?
</p>

<p>
The door was suddenly <a class="a3b">opened</a>. Clean-shaved men appeared, bringing chests and carrying the furniture; then the door closed once more on the <a class="a4b">servant</a> who was removing packages of <a class="a2">books</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a class="a1">Des Esseintes</a> sank into a chair.
</p>

<p class="lastpar">
"I shall be in <a class="a5">Paris</a> in two days. Well, all is finished. The waves of <a class="a4">human</a> mediocrity rise to the <a class="a4b">sky</a> and they will engulf the <a class="a5b">refuge</a> whose dams I open. Ah! courage leaves me, my heart breaks! O Lord, pity the Christian who doubts, the sceptic who would believe, the convict of life <a class="a4">embarking</a> alone in the night, under a sky no longer <a class="a1">illumined</a> by the <a class="a4b">consoling</a> beacons of ancient <a class="a3b">faith</a>."
